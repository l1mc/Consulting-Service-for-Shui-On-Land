This repository stores the programs I wrote while providing consulting services for Shui On Land.  

## My job in this project
* We help clients find high-net-worth individuals in Shanghai, making it easier for our clients to grasp their needs.
* My job is to help my boss locate which industries have the most high-net-worth individuals today and in the future,
* I analyze the rise and fall of various industries from the perspective of online public opinion, listing conditions, and senior executives' annual salary data.  

## Public Opinion
* **NewRankAPI-Douyin.py**: To use NewRank API to download and save information -- such as likes, comments, reads, pulish time, text -- about aritles in WeChat official account.  
* **NewRankAPI-WeChat.py**: To use NewRank API to download and save information -- such as watches, comments, music, title -- about videos in Douyin.  

## Listing Conditions
* **Listing.py**: To analyze the number of new listed companies in different industries each year. Our assumptions is that the industry that has gradually increased the number of annual listings is the sunrise industry. There are more high-net-worth individuals in these industries.

## The annual salary of directors and senior management
* They are high-net-worth individuals and potential customers of Shui On.
* In industries where directors and executives are at a new high, generally speaking, the middle management will also have a stronger economic strength.
